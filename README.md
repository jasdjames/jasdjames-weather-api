## Usage
The page functions mostly as it should. The names do not append to the "previous searches" exactly as I would have liked and as I would have completed with more time and research. 


## Credits
 Will Utterback has grown to someone that it is easy to collaborate with on projects. I bounces ideas off of him to see if they would work. He also helped me to see things in other ways.
